# Ansible Template Skeletons

## Overview
`ansible-template-skeletons` is an automated tool designed to keep your Ansible project's directory structure in sync with the latest recommendations from the official Ansible documentation. Utilizing GitHub Actions, this project checks the Ansible documentation daily for changes in the recommended project layout and automatically updates this repository to reflect those changes, ensuring best practices are always followed.

## Features
- **Automated Updates**: Leverages GitHub Actions to regularly check the Ansible documentation for any updates or changes in the directory structure.
- **Pull Request Management**: Automatically generates pull requests for changes, allowing for human review before merging.
- **Version Tagging**: Upon acceptance and merging of changes, the project is tagged with the current date, marking the version of the directory structure.

## Current Templates
<!-- TEMPLATE_START -->
<!-- Content dynamically generated by `build_structure_string(parsed_structure)` will appear here. -->
<!-- TEMPLATE_END -->

### Assumptions
This workflow is predicated on several stable factors:
- The [Ansible Sample Setup Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/tips_tricks/sample_setup.html) remains accessible and unchanged in its URL.
- Sample Ansible setups, illustrating best practices for project structures, continue to be provided within this documentation.
- The documentation's underlying HTML, particularly the CSS selectors, remain consistent for `retrieve.py`.

    
For minor changes to these factors, see `config.ini`.  For significant changes to these factors, adjustments to the workflow and parsing scripts may be necessary to maintain the functionality of this automated tool.
